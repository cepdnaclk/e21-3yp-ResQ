                                As part of the project's early-stage evaluation, the Proposal Presentation Session for Milestone 1 was conducted
                                to present ResQ to Ms. Yasodha Vimukthi and Mr. Thilina Gunarathne. The session focused on validating the
                                feasibility, clarity, and overall direction of the proposed solution. We discussed the motivation behind ResQ,
                                its intended functionality, and its potential impact on CPR training.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The evaluators confirmed the relevance of the proposed idea and provided constructive feedback, particularly
                                emphasizing the importance of budget feasibility and alignment with recognized CPR training standards. They also
                                recommended engaging with resource persons from the Faculty of Allied Health Sciences to verify clinical
                                requirements and clarify any additional needs.

                                Overall, the session was a valuable learning experience that strengthened our understanding of real-world
                                constraints and expectations. The feedback received will guide further research, planning, and refinement of the
                                ResQ system to ensure it is practical, standards-compliant, and technically robust.

                    <p class="post-subtitle">
                        We presented ResQ to temporary instructors of the Department of Computer Engineering,
                        University of Peradeniya, to validate feasibility and gather early technical feedback.

                    <p>
                        As part of the early-stage validation of our project, a mock proposal session was conducted to present ResQ
                        to the temporary instructors of the Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The session aimed to evaluate the feasibility, technical soundness, and practical relevance of the proposed
                        solution at an early stage. We discussed the limitations of conventional CPR training manikins and explained
                        how ResQ uses embedded sensing to provide real-time, objective feedback on compression quality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The instructors offered valuable feedback on system architecture, sensor accuracy, scalability, and alignment
                        with CPR training standards. These insights helped us critically assess our initial assumptions and identify
                        areas requiring further investigation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, the mock proposal session served as an important milestone in refining the direction of the ResQ
                        project. The feedback received will directly inform further research, system optimization, and design decisions,
                        ensuring that the proposed solution is technically sound, pedagogically effective, and aligned with real-world
                        CPR training requirements.
